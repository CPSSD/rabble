        <h4>Welcome to Rabble!</h4>
        <p>Rabble is a new federated blogging platform that aims to be easy to use, trustworthy, and lightweight.</p>

        <h4>Be part of the federation.</h4>
        <p>This is just one instance in a network of connected servers. You can choose to register on whichever Rabble
        server you like, and you'll be able to follow and interact with authors on other Rabble servers on the network.
        You are free to choose a server based on what's important to you; be it community rules, uptime, language,
        interface, or anything else.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, Rabble uses the <a href="https://activitypub.rocks">ActivityPub protocol</a> to achieve
        this federation.</p>

        <h4>Go beyond Rabble.</h4>
        <p>You can use Rabble to follow your favourite RSS feeds, and you can follow a Rabble blog from your own RSS
        reader as well. Rabble will also eventually support interacting with other ActivityPub-compliant services,
        like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://joinpeertube.org">PeerTube</a>, and&nbsp;
        <a href="https://plume-org.github.io/Plume/">Plume</a>.</p>

        <h4>Interested?</h4>

        Ruane, under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Foster and Dr. Andrew McCarren.</p>
